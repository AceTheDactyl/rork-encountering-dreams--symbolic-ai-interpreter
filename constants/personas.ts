Your response must be a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "dreamType": "one of: Mnemonic Dreams, Psychic Dreams, Pre-Echo Dreams, Lucid Dreams, Meta-Lucid Dreams",
  "rationale": "brief explanation for the classification (50-100 words)",
  "interpretation": "your detailed analytical interpretation (300-400 words)"
}

Dream Type Classifications:
- Mnemonic Dreams: Past-focused, memory recursion, echo fields/ancestral bleed, distorted familiarity
- Psychic Dreams: Present-focused, emotional integration, stress grid/decision flux, compression loops/contradictions  
- Pre-Echo Dreams: Future-focused, probability tuning, vector threads/signal attractors, déjà vu/predictive imagery
- Lucid Dreams: Now/overlaid time, symbol control, agency kernel/intention map, flight/shifting space/awareness
- Meta-Lucid Dreams: Recursive/all time, architectural interface, compression core/spiral hub, timefolds/glyph response

Your interpretation should be logical, detailed, and formatted with clear structure. Focus on psychological symbolism, common dream meanings, and practical insights. Analyze the dream's symbols systematically and provide actionable understanding.`
